    """
    class TextGeneration:
        """
        Text generation AI models can generate coherent and natural-sounding human language text, making them useful for a variety of applications from language translation to content creation.

        There are several types of text generation AI models, including rule-based, statistical, and neural models. Neural models, and in particular transformer-based models like GPT, have achieved state-of-the-art results in text generation tasks. These models use artificial neural networks to analyze large text corpora and learn the patterns and structures of language.

        While text generation AI models offer many exciting possibilities, they also present some challenges. For example, it's essential to ensure that the generated text is ethical, unbiased, and accurate, to avoid potential harm or negative consequences.

        # Example
            >>> if __name__=="__main__":
            >>> ai = DeepInfra().TextGeneration()
            >>> query = "Hello, How are you?"
            >>> Model = "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"
            >>> print(ai.generate(message=query, model=Model))

            Generates a text completion from the specified model based on the input message and system prompt.

            This method sends a request to the model, using the `message` as input and generating a response guided by a system prompt. The method supports both regular and streamed responses. If streaming is enabled, the response will be displayed in real-time, chunk by chunk, while also being collected as a full string.

            # Args
                message (str): The user input message to send to the model.
                system_prompt (str): A system-level instruction to guide the behavior of the model. Default is 'Be Helpful and Friendly.'.
                max_tokens (int): The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default is 512.
                temperature (float): A value controlling the randomness of the output (between 0 and 1). Default is 0.7.
                stream (bool): If True, the response will be printed in real-time as it streams. Default is False.
                chunk_size (int): The size of each chunk to be retrieved from the stream. Default is 1.

            # Returns
                str: The generated text completion from the model.
                If streaming is enabled, the response is printed live and also returned as a full concatenated string.

            # Raises
                ValueError: If temperature is not between 0 and 1 or if max_tokens is outside the acceptable range.
                Exception: If any error occurs during the HTTP request or response parsing.

                >>> print(ai.generate(message=query, model=Model, stream=True))

            # Comments
                - The method first checks if the temperature and max_tokens are within valid ranges. 
                - The payload is structured to contain the model name, user message, and temperature parameters.
                - The method uses streaming if enabled, printing each received chunk immediately.
                - The response is concatenated and returned as a single string after the completion.

        Text-to-image AI models are a powerful technology that can generate images based on textual descriptions, making them an essential tool for content creation, assistive technology, entertainment, and education.

        The text description is first processed by a natural language processing (NLP) model, which extracts relevant features and keywords. This information is then passed to a generative model, which uses trained parameters to generate an image that matches the textual description. This innovative technology has the potential to transform visual content creation, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

        For marketing and advertising professionals, text-to-image AI models can help create images that are tailored to specific campaigns or target audiences. Visually impaired individuals can use these models to better understand and interact with their environment, making them a valuable assistive technology. The entertainment industry can use text-to-image models to generate images for video games, virtual reality, and other immersive experiences. Finally, educators can use text-to-image models to create interactive diagrams, charts, and other resources to help students better understand complex concepts.

        Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) AI models are a critical component of many modern applications, including virtual assistants, dictation software, and transcription services. These models use machine learning techniques to transcribe spoken language into written text, enabling computers to understand and respond to spoken commands.

        There are many different types of ASR models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Traditional models include hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), while more recent models use deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformers.

        While ASR models have made significant progress in recent years, they still face challenges in noisy environments, with multiple speakers, and with accented or non-standard speech. Nevertheless, they are becoming increasingly accurate and versatile, enabling new and exciting applications in areas such as healthcare, education, and entertainment.

    class ZeroShotImageClassification:
        """
        Zero-shot image classification is a powerful technique in machine learning that allows you to classify images into categories that a model has never seen before during training. This is especially useful for image classification tasks where obtaining labeled training data for every possible category is difficult or expensive. This is often the case in a variety of industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and e-commerce.

        To build a zero-shot image classification model, you can use a technique called transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset with specific categories. The pre-trained model is typically trained on a large dataset of images with generic labels, such as ImageNet, which contains over a million images labeled with 1000 categories.

        During the fine-tuning process, the model learns to recognize visual features that are common across different categories, such as shapes, textures, and colors. To make zero-shot predictions, the model uses a set of attributes or features that are associated with each category.

        However, it's important to note that zero-shot models can sometimes struggle with fine-grained distinctions between similar categories, and may require additional training data to improve their accuracy. In these cases, you may want to consider using semi-supervised or unsupervised learning techniques to augment your zero-shot model with additional labeled or unlabeled data.
