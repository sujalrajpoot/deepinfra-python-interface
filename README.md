# DeepInfra Python Interface
This is a Python interface for interacting with the DeepInfra API. DeepInfra provides access to powerful machine learning models, which include large language models (LLMs), automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and zero-shot image classification models.

# Features

This project provides a Python interface to interact with various models hosted by the DeepInfra API, enabling users to leverage state-of-the-art machine learning technologies. Here are the main features:

### Text Generation:
- Generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on user-provided prompts.
- Supports custom system prompts to guide the tone and purpose of responses.
- Adjustable parameters such as maximum token count and temperature for creative or focused outputs.
- Stream or chunk outputs for efficient processing of large text generations.

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):
- Transcribe audio files into text using cutting-edge models like Whisper-large-v3.
- Supports both transcription and translation tasks from audio.
- Handles different file formats and audio quality variations.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS):
- Convert written text into human-like speech.
- Choose from multiple voices (e.g., "Aura") for customized audio outputs.
- Save generated speech files locally in formats like .mp3 for easy playback.
- Ideal for accessibility tools, virtual assistants, or voice-driven applications.

### Zero-Shot Image Classification:
- Classify images into categories that the model has not explicitly been trained on.
- Leverages models like Clip-vit-base-patch32 to perform image classification tasks with no prior training data.
- Highly flexible for classifying images in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and e-commerce.

### API Interaction:
- Simplifies the process of interacting with DeepInfraâ€™s API.
- Offers customizable model parameters, allowing users to tailor results for different use cases.
- Supports bearer token authentication for secure access to DeepInfra's services.

### Model Listing:
- List available models for each task (text generation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, image classification).
- Helps users discover and choose the right model for their specific use case.

### Modular Structure:
- Organized into separate classes for each type of task (TextGeneration, ASR, TTS, and ZeroShotImageClassification), allowing for easy integration and extension.
- Clean, readable code that can be extended with additional tasks or model functionalities as DeepInfra expands its offerings.

### Cross-Task Integration:
- Use generated text from one task as input for another (e.g., generate text and convert it to speech).
- Seamlessly combine various AI tasks to build complex AI-driven applications.

# How It Can Help

- This feature set makes the project versatile and powerful, ideal for developers who need to integrate advanced machine learning capabilities such as text generation, speech recognition, and image classification into their applications.

# Requirements

- Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- re (part of Pythonâ€™s standard library)
- json (part of Pythonâ€™s standard library)
- base64 (part of Pythonâ€™s standard library)
- random (part of Pythonâ€™s standard library)
- Literal (part of Pythonâ€™s standard library typing's part)
- requests

### You can install the required packages using pip:

- pip install requests
# Usage/Examples

```python
from DeepInfra import DeepInfra

if __name__=="__main__":
    init = DeepInfra()
    # For Testing of TextGeneration
    print(init.TextGeneration().generate(message="Hello, How are you?", model="Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"))
    print(init.TextGeneration().generate(message="Hello, How are you?", model="Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct", stream=True))

    # For Testing of AutomaticSpeechRecognition
    print(init.AutomaticSpeechRecognition().generate(audio_file_path="./Test_Data/English.mp3", task="transcribe", model="Whisper-large-v3"))
    print(init.AutomaticSpeechRecognition().generate(audio_file_path="./Test_Data/Hindi.mp3", task="translate", model="Whisper-large-v3"))

    # For Testing of TextToSpeech
    print(init.TextToSpeech().generate(text="Text-to-Speech technology converts written text into spoken words using advanced speech synthesis by the DeepInfra API.",voice="Aura",output_filename="output_file.mp3"))

    # For Testing of ZeroShotImageClassification
    print(init.ZeroShotImageClassification().generate(image_path="./Test_Data/cat.jpg", model="Clip-vit-base-patch32", bearer_token="Bearer jwt:eyJxxxfc", candidate_labels=["cat", "dog"]))
    print(init.ZeroShotImageClassification().generate(image_path="./Test_Data/dog.jpg", model="Clip-vit-base-patch32", bearer_token="Bearer jwt:eyJxxxfc", candidate_labels=["cat", "dog"]))
```
